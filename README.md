ReplyBot is a Customizable Auto-Reply Assistant.
ReplyBot is a powerful and highly flexible utility for Android that automatically replies to incoming messages from your favorite chat applications. Designed for busy professionals, developers, and anyone looking to manage their notifications more efficiently, ReplyBot goes beyond simple canned responses by integrating cutting-edge AI to generate intelligent, context-aware replies.
At its core, ReplyBot works by securely reading your notifications and sending a pre-configured or AI-generated response on your behalf. But its true power lies in its deep customization options, giving you complete control over how, when, and to whom it replies.
Key Features:

Contact Filtering: Use the built-in contact selector to create allow-lists or block-lists, ensuring replies are only sent to specific people or groups.

Privacy-Focused: With the "Bring Your Own Key" model for AI features, your data is sent directly from your device to the AI provider. We do not act as a middleman, ensuring maximum privacy.
